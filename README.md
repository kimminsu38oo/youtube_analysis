## API Endpoints

### Traditional Analysis Endpoint
**Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/analysis/{analysis_id}`
**Request**: Upload two files - `history_file` and `subscriptions_file`
**Response**: Returns a complete analysis in a single response

```json

    "hourlyStats": [...],
    "keywordFrequency": [...],
    "llmAnalysis": "User tends to watch entertainment content in the evening."
  }
}
```

### Streaming Analysis Endpoint
**Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/analysis-stream/{analysis_id}`
**Request**: Upload two files - `history_file` and `subscriptions_file`
**Response**: Streams analysis results incrementally as they're processed

1. **Hourly Statistics Analysis**
```json
{
  "function": "hourly_stats",
  "status": "success",
  "data": [
    {
      "hour": 0,
      "totalViews": 0,
      "categories": []
    },
    {
      "hour": 18,
      "totalViews": 200,
      "categories": [
        {"name": "Entertainment", "views": 121},
        {"name": "Education", "views": 79}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

2. **Keyword Analysis**
```json
{
  "function": "keyword_frequency",
  "status": "success",
  "data": [
    {"keyword": "Music", "frequency": 150},
    {"keyword": "Gaming", "frequency": 100},
    {"keyword": "Entertainment", "frequency": 80},
    {"keyword": "Education", "frequency": 60},
    {"keyword": "Sports", "frequency": 40}
  ]
}
```

3. **LLM Analysis**
```json
{
  "function": "llm_analysis",
  "status": "success",
  "data": "The user tends to watch YouTube mainly during evening hours (18-20), with a preference for entertainment and educational content. Key interests include music and gaming. The viewing pattern suggests YouTube is primarily used for relaxation after work hours."
}
```

4. **Completion Message**
```json
{
  "function": "completion",
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Analysis completed successfully."
}
```

## Testing the Streaming API
You can test the streaming functionality using the included `test.html` file:
1. Open the `test.html` file in your web browser
2. Enter the server URL (default: http://localhost:8000)
3. Upload your history.json and subscriptions.json files
4. Click "Start Analysis" to see the real-time streaming results
5. Each analysis component will update as soon as it's processed by the server

The test page includes a visualization of hourly statistics, keyword frequency tags, and the LLM analysis, all updating in real-time as data is received from the server.

## Client Implementation
To consume the streaming endpoint, clients should process each JSON response as it arrives. The test.html file provides a reference implementation for handling the streamed responses.
